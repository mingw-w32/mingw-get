      identified by substituting the catalogue name for the "%F" field

      The system map specifies the installation paths for each managed
      subsystem.  Multiple system maps are supported, provided each is
      given a unique "id" attribute; each specifies an "installation",
      comprising a collection of subsystems, each of which in turn is
      associated with a specific "sysroot path".

      In the case of the setup tool, we require only a single sysroot
      specification, relating to the default installation path.
