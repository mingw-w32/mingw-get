Installation Instructions
=========================

$Id$

The information which follows describes the procedure for installing
and configuring mingw-get, and for keeping the installation current.
The online version of this document is an abridged form, focussing on
the installation of binary releases; users who prefer to build and
install from source are advised to consult the unabridged form of
this document, which may be found in the file "INSTALL", within the
source code distribution tarball.

Please report bugs as directed at http://mingw.org/Reporting_Bugs


First Time Installation of a Current Binary Release
---------------------------------------------------

Note that, as of release 0.6.0, the installation procedure for mingw-get
has been significantly simplified.  The installation instructions which
follow relate to this release, and later; for instructions relating to
any earlier release, or if you are unable to run the new setup tool on
any legacy version of Windows, please refer to the following section,
under the heading "First Time Installation of a Legacy Binary Release".

To install mingw-get, visit the MinGW files repository at:

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files

then, from the "Installer" folder,
download and run mingw-get-setup.exe, and select your choices from the
options presented [*], to install mingw-get.  When this has completed,
you will then be offered the option to immediately continue with the
installation of a basic selection of MinGW packages [**].  If you do
choose to continue with package selection, this will be processed by an
integrated preview of the mingw-get GUI application, (regardless of
whether you have accepted or declined the option to install the GUI); to
complete your initial installation:--

- Select individual packages, within the upper right hand "list-view"
  pane of the GUI window;

- From the "Package" menu, (which also appears as a pop-up, when you
  click the status icon at the left hand side of the list entry), select
  the option to "Mark for Installation", in respect of each package
  which you wish to install;

- Having so marked all packages which you wish to install, from the
  "Installation" menu select the "Apply Changes" option, to complete
  your initial installation.

After you have completed the installation of mingw-get, as described
above, and regardless of whether you chose to install additional
packages, or not, you are advised to review the configuration, as
specified in your profile.xml file, and noting in particular, any new
features which are described in the supplied defaults.xml file, if you
have a profile.xml from a previous release; please refer to the section
below, under the heading "Specifying the Configuration", for details.

[*] By default, mingw-get-setup.exe will offer to install mingw-get into
the "C:\MinGW" directory.  You are *strongly* recommended to adopt this
default; however, if you do decide to change it, please *do* choose an
alternative with no white space within its absolute path name.
In particular, those who choose to ignore
this advice, and install MinGW into some subdirectory of (for example)
C:\Program&nbsp;Files", usually discover to their cost that certain
tools may not work correctly.

[**] The set of packages offered, as the foundation for a basic
installation, are equivalent to those offered by the mingw-get-inst.exe
companion to earlier releases of mingw-get.  Unlike mingw-get-inst.exe,
mingw-get-setup.exe, does *not* insist that you install the basic GCC
compiler suite.  You are free to install it, or not, at your own option;
if you do wish to install it, please select the "mingw32-base" package,
which is the equivalent of the minimum mandatory selection imposed by
mingw-get-inst.exe


First Time Installation of a Legacy Binary Release
--------------------------------------------------

The instructions which follow relate to the installation of mingw-get
releases prior to version 0.6.0; they also apply in the case of later
versions, where a legacy version of Windows may not permit you to run
the new mingw-get-setup.exe tool.  For installation of release 0.6.0, or
any later release, using the new tool, please refer to the preceeding
section, under the heading "First Time Installation of a Current Binary
Release".

To install mingw-get, visit the MinGW files repository at:

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files

and, from the "Installer/mingw-get-<version>-<class>-<release>" folder,
download your choice of either:

    mingw-get-<version>-mingw32-<class>-<release>-bin.zip

or (preferred, if you know how to unpack it):

    mingw-get-<version>-mingw32-<class>-<release>-bin.tar.xz

Whichever of these you choose to download, you should unpack it into
the directory in which you intend to host your MinGW installation; (we
*strongly* recommend that you adopt our standard of C:\MinGW [*], unless
you have an exceptional reason to make an alternative choice), then use
your preferred method for assignment of environment variables to add the
appropriate directory (default C:\MinGW\bin) to your PATH; (this should
be added as a permanent PATH assignment).

Having completed this phase of installation, you may then wish to review
the following section on configuration; if nothing else, you may wish to
copy the supplied defaults.xml file to profile.xml, even if you choose not
to introduce any customisations.  Finally, to initialise the installation
recording database, you should run the command [**]:

    C:\> mingw-get install mingw-get


[*] If you insist on adopting a different directory from the recommended
default, you are *strongly* advised to avoid any directory which has white
space in its absolute path name; in particular, those who choose to ignore
this advice, and install MinGW into some subdirectory of (for example)
C:\Program&nbsp;Files", usually discover to their cost that certain
tools may not work correctly.

This document will refer to files as though installed in the recommended
default location, with a path prefix of C:\MinGW.  If, having read the
above warning, you do decide to adopt an alternative installation path,
then please substitute your alternative prefix, as appropriate, where this
document refers to C:\MinGW.  

[**] If you have chosen {PACKAGE_DISTNAME}-bin.tar.xz as your installation
source, rather than {PACKAGE_DISTNAME}-bin.zip, you may like to create the
directory:

    C:\MinGW\var\cache\mingw-get\packages

(together with any requisite parents, and adjusting the C:\MinGW prefix
to suit your installation choice, if necessary).  You may then move the
{PACKAGE_DISTNAME}-bin.tar.gz file to it, *before* you run the above
command; this will relieve mingw-get of the overhead which would be
incurred by downloading the file a second time.  


Specifying the Configuration
----------------------------

When you invoke mingw-get, it will attempt to read configuration data
from the file:

    C:\MinGW\var\lib\mingw-get\data\profile.xml

(with any necessary adjustment of the C:\MinGW installation prefix, as
noted previously); if, and only if, this file cannot be read, then a
fallback attempt will be made, to read the configuration from:

    C:\MinGW\var\lib\mingw-get\data\defaults.xml

instead.  Of this pair of files, profile.xml is *not* included within
the mingw-get distribution, but defaults.xml *is*.  It is a liberally
commented XML file, which you are advised to copy to create profile.xml;
you may then modify this, as you see fit, to suit your own installation
requirements. [*]

At the present time, the only entries you should consider changing are
the path names specified by the "path" attribute associated with each
of the "sysroot" elements within the first (only) "system-map" element;
(these specify the prefix directory path names for your installation).
You probably want to make the path for the "mingw32" subsystem match
your choice for your mingw-get installation; (the "%R" notation, used
in defaults.xml, sets it up thus, regardless of whether you choose to
install in C:\MinGW, or an alternative location).

[*] The recommendation to copy defaults.xml to profile.xml may seem to
be an unnecessary inconvenience; it is implemented this way in order to
safeguard any configuration changes you wish to make; during an upgrade,
defaults.xml will be overwritten, but profile.xml will not, so your
configuration will be preserved.


Upgrading an Existing Installation to a Newer Binary Release
------------------------------------------------------------

Once you have completed a first-time installation of mingw-get, whether
from a binary release or by building and installing from source, you may
wish to upgrade it, as the project team publishes new releases.  Unless
you insist on *always* installing from source, (in which case each
upgrade effectively becomes a fresh first-time installation from the
new source code), and provided:

- you have previously installed mingw-get-0.1-mingw32-alpha-3 or newer,
  and

- you have completed the first-time installation process, by running

      C:\> mingw-get install mingw-get

then you may upgrade to a newer binary release by running

!     C:\> mingw-get update
!     C:\> mingw-get upgrade mingw-get

Otherwise, if you have a previously unfinalised installation, i.e. you
did not previously run

      C:\> mingw-get install mingw-get

and that previous installation is of mingw-get-0.1-mingw32-alpha-3 or
newer, then you may upgrade and finalise by running

!     C:\> mingw-get update
!     C:\> mingw-get install mingw-get

Alternatively, any previous installation of mingw-get may be upgraded
by simply performing a new first-time installation, overwriting the
previously installed version; (this is the only option available, if
the original installation predates mingw-get-0.1-mingw32-alpha-3).

Building and Installing from Source
-----------------------------------

In order to build mingw-get from source, you will require:

- A build platform which is capable of running Bourne shell scripts,
  which provides at least the set of core tools required by the GNU
  Coding Standards, together with a C/C++ compiler suite generating
  code for execution on a native MS-Windows host.  Suitable platforms
  include MSYS, in it's normal MinGW personality, with the MinGW
  compiler suite, or either of Cygwin or GNU/Linux, with a suitable
  cross-compiler suite for a MinGW host. 

- A statically linkable libz.a (or equal) for the native MS-Windows
  host, together with its associated header files.

- A statically linkable libbz2.a (or equal) for the native MS-Windows
  host, together with its associated header files.

- A statically linkable liblzma.a (or equal) for the native MS-Windows
  host, together with its associated header files; (this should be built
  from libxz sources no older than version 4.999.9beta, with a snapshot
  release date of 2009-12-09 or later).

- A statically linkable liblua.a for the native MS-Windows host,
  together with its associated header files; (this should be binary
  compatible with the lua-5.2.0 release, as offered by MinGW.org).

- A statically linkable libwtklite.a, together with its associated
  header files; (this is a MinGW.org specific product, currently offered
  only in source format, which you are advised to build and install for
  yourself).

Having provisioned a suitable build platform, with these pre-requisite
libraries installed, you should obtain and unpack the source tarball,
{PACKAGE_DISTNAME}-src.tar.gz, in any working directory of your choice,
to create your {PACKAGE_DIRNAME} source directory.

At this point, you may elect to build in-source, in which case you would
follow the conventional GNU build procedure:

!   $ cd {PACKAGE_DIRNAME}
!   $ ./configure --prefix=/mingw [options ...]
!   $ make

However, it is strongly recommended that you elect instead, to create
and use a separate build directory.  This may be a subdirectory of your
{PACKAGE_DIRNAME} source directory, e.g.&nbsp;build-dir, in which case
you would proceed as follows:

!   $ mkdir {PACKAGE_DIRNAME}/build-dir
!   $ cd {PACKAGE_DIRNAME}/build-dir
!   $ ../configure --prefix=/mingw [options ...]
!   $ make

Finally, if you are building on the host on which you intend to deploy,
and provided the build has completed without error, you may install
mingw-get by executing:

!   $ make install

or:

!   $ make install-strip

Alternatively, if you wish to create an installation kit for deployment
on any remote host, you may:

!   $ mkdir staged
!   $ make prefix=`pwd`/staged install

or:

!   $ mkdir staged
!   $ make prefix=`pwd`/staged install-strip

and then:

!   $ cd staged
!   $ tar cf ../{PACKAGE_DISTNAME}-inst.tar .

to create an installation tarball, which may be deployed simply by
unpacking it in the /mingw root directory, on any host you choose.


Building and Installing from Source in Git
------------------------------------------

If, rather than building mingw-get from the source code provided in the
form of a release tarball, you prefer to keep on the cutting edge of
development within the public CVS repository, there are a few additional
pre-requisites which you must satisfy on your build platform:

- You must have either a git client, or a mercurial client with the
  hggit extension enabled, which you can use to fetch the source code
  from the repository, and subsequently keep it current.

- You must have the GNU autoconf package, with a version number of 2.59
  or later, (and preferrably 2.67 or later).

- You must have a working lex, (or flex), scanner generating tool.

- If you also wish to be able to generate the documentation files, as
  included in the top level directory of a source distribution tarball,
  you will need a working nroff implementation.

Provided you can satisfy (at least the first three of) these additional
pre-requisites, you may check out the latest source code thus [*]:

!   $ git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/mingw/mingw-get

or:

!   $ hg clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/mingw/mingw-get

This will create a working copy of the mingw-get source tree, in the
mingw-get subdirectory of your current working directory [**].

[*] If you are an accredited MinGW Developer, you may prefer to use the
SSH access protocol for git, in conjunction with your registered SSH
keys, to access the git repository; in this case, you should know the
appropriate procedure to use, in place of the above.

[**] Note that, if you are a git user, you *must* perform an additional
checkout step, (which is not necessary for hg users):

!   $ cd mingw-get
!   $ git submodule add ../build-aux

Having thus obtained your working copy of the source code from the git
repository, you should then:

!   $ cd mingw-get
!   $ autoconf

(git users should omit the 'cd mingw-get' step, since they will already
be in the appropriate directory, following the addition of the build-aux
submodule), to generate the configure script, and then:

!   $ mkdir obj
!   $ cd obj
!   $ ../configure --prefix=/mingw [options ...]
!   $ make

to progress the build [***], as in the previous case of building from
the source code extracted from a distribution tarball.

[***] Notice that here we choose to build in a subdirectory called obj;
when building from source in git, building in-source becomes even less
desirable than it is when building from distributed source.  The choice
of obj for the build directory name is dictated by the configuration of
mingw-get's git module itself; both git and hg "know" that this
directory does not contain any source files of interest to them.
